        functions and methods associated with animating elements within web browsers. Though there are 
        several ways to achieve this, the key here was the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame" target="_blank" >requestAnimationFrame</a> method, 
        which tells the browser to call a specified function to update an animation right before the next repaint.
        While this project may not be perfect, presentational and functional goals were met, demonstrating
        one of the many ways to animate elements and express yourself through technology.</p>,

        description: <p>Scroll through a website that advertises "Replicat", a product 
        brought to you by the fictional company, "The Siber Corporation." The 
        goal of this project was to create a fully responsive and functional 
        webpage capable of accomdating various device types and screen sizes. This was accomplished
        by researching and experimenting with common breakpoints, then adjusting the page's
        content accordingly. Though this page may appear simple, it serves as a great example  
        of the "what if" mindset one needs to make sure everything is as intended for end-users.</p>,

        this project was to prioritize creating functionality and 
        user interactivity in web development, rather than the 
        structuring and styling aspects of it. One of the ways I accomplished this
        was by creating a form that stored user input in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage" target="_blank">localStorage</a>, which was 
        used across the application for further functionality and interactivity. 
        The biggest lesson from working on this project was the importance of organization 
        and clarity in code development. Whether that be commenting on functions 
        or ordering them in a certain fashion so that they can be easier to return to
        when encountering errors or to make adjustments.
